      </header>
      <div class="main">
        <p>Vikings Robotics is a student run team from La Jolla High school. Our team has 20 full time members, and 2 full-time mentors.</p>
<p>Most of our members have little prior knowledge when they join our team; the skills that people learn through FIRST Robotics canâ€™t be easily taught in a classroom or learned at home.</p>
<p>Prior team members continue to use what they have learned into college and adult life. Members have gone on to pursue STEM degrees at engineering focused colleges such as Cal Tech, MIT, UC Berkeley, and Cal Poly SLO.</p>
<h1 id="mission-statement">Mission Statement</h1>
<p>Vikings Robotics support the building of real world skills, instilling an appreciation for STEM fields in our members as well as giving back to the community through our outreach programs with local schools and groups.</p>
<h1 id="community-outreach">Community Outreach</h1>
<p>Our team has hundreds of volunteer hours logged with local elementary schools such as Bird Rock and La Jolla Elementary. We help elementary school teams participate in the FIRST Lego League. We also participate in outreach with Muirlands Middle School. We strive with our local community to promote participation in robotics and inspire the next generation of Scientists and Engineers.</p>
