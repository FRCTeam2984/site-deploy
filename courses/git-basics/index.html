<p>For those wishing to get somewhat proficient with Github this explanation can give you the very basics.</p>
<p>With Git you will be typing in names of files and directories. Sometimes they are created by you sometimes they are created by other people. If you aren’t directly working with the person you may not remember if they use capitol letters or if whether they use spaces or dashes to separate words. To avoid confusion, everyone in Robotics uses kabob-case. In this style all words consist ONLY of lower case letters and words are connected by dashes.</p>
<p>Git is a Distributed VCS, on Github there is a remote repository that acts as the main version of the project a group of people are working on.</p>
<p>When you work on Github you <em>pull</em> from the remote repository, this acts as the local <em>repository</em>. Changes you make to the code will change the <em>local repository</em> and not the <em>main repository</em>. This allows many people to work on the same project without changing the original it also allows mistakes to be easily found since updates are restricted to limited changes and can always be rolled back.</p>
<p>Make sure to use <strong>Ubuntu</strong>/<strong>Linux</strong> this will allow you to be on the same level of expertise as the rest of the team and allow people to help you easily.</p>
<p>To start open the <em>Terminal</em> you can do so by opening the Application finder in the bottom left corner.</p>
<p>Do these commands when you start using the Terminal
git config –global user.name
git config –global user.email</p>
<p>The way your local repository will work:<br><strong>Working Directory</strong>-<br>Where you make changes to the code (Does not affect the main repository)<br><strong>Staging Area</strong>-<br>The place before it the changes are committed<br><strong>Commit to Repository</strong>-<br>Changes your local repository which can be pushed to the main repository  </p>
<p>When you want to make a new project:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Open Github and create an account. Make your username and password simple because you will need to repeatedly enter this info when you make commits.</li>
<li>2 Create a Directory, by typing mkdir <strong>_</strong>  in the future make it descriptive but for now call it test. Don’t change any of the preset settings.</li>
<li>3 Click back on Terminal. Use ls to see what is in the folder.</li>
<li>4 You most likely have a Documents folder we will be using that one. If you don’t have one you can just make a folder. Use cd Documents to move into the documents directory.</li>
<li>5 Use cd test to get into the test folder.</li>
<li>6 Now use git init to create a file that will allow you to ‘push’ with Git</li>
<li>7 To create the Repository use git remote <strong>__</strong> <url> name it origin</li>
<li>8 Now you have an empty repository on your computer and a repository on Github</li>
</ul>
<p>To write your first file and push to Repository:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Write something on Leafpad/Notepad</li>
<li>2 Save it to the Directory named Test</li>
<li>3 Click on the Terminal. Type git add -A</li>
<li>4 Type git commit -m “First Commit”</li>
<li>5 Type git push origin master</li>
<li>6 Click on GitHub you know just changed the main version</li>
</ul>
