<p>The game consists of trying to place blocks on switches to tip it in your favor. Basically more cubes means more points.</p>
<p> The competition also has a raised scale which is in the middle of the field which is 5 feet off the ground almost as tall as a human being!</p>
<p>The team can also trade in cubes for “power ups” that benefit the team such as getting double points or gaining control of the switch or scale.</p>
<p>Each team has “portals” on opposing sides of the field allowing human players to feed cubes to the robot.</p>
<p>All in all there is more than 50 cubes that can be on the field at once each 13 inches.</p>
<p>At the end of the game the robots get a chance to climb up the scale and need to be 12 inches off the ground to score points.</p>
<p>The objective of the game is to get the most amount of points and win the match! This year there are a few ways to earn points and it’s now up to our team to find out what way we want to get them!</p>
