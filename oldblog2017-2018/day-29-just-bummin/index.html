<p>There is not much going on, at least on this side of the arena. The hustle and bustle just seems to drone on as everything fits into place. It’s really weird because everyone is doing their jobs and there is like this understanding setting in that we need to get this done. Whether you think that’s good or quiet doesn’t matter as since the previous leader of Communications is helping the drive team, I am now the highest ranking person in the wing. It’s lonely at the top boys and girls. I love you all.</p>

<p>Mechanical is working on making parts for the arm and other miscellaneous pieces for the robot. I wish i could tell you more folks but thats the information described to me.</p>

<p>Electrical is learning about what exactly Photo reactive sensors are (Also called limit switches but it doesn’t make much difference to me because I don’t know what they do either way) But basically they can connect to each other and shoot a light to the other one to see if there is something between them. They’re also looking to find a camera for the robot, good luck with their hunt.</p>
<p>Drive team is trying to deconstruct the cube zone without getting the cubes outside the zone so the other team can get their greasy mechanical paws on them. They are also working on being able to grab the cubes from behind the switch.</p>

<p>Communications is busy still making stickers, writing an elevator pitch for the Pearl of Pizza, and writing the blog to keep y’all informed and entertained. In other words, we’re the backbone of the team. And now with me as temporary leader, i’ll shape this team into greatness.</p>
<p>The mood is hopeful yet pragmatic</p>
