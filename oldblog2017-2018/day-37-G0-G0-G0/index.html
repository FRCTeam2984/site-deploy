<p>I was sick and  couldn’t make it yesterday so this is all based off of Tanvir’s rundown. I love you all and I try to make it to every meeting because I know my readers thirst for the knowledge of the happenings of the robotics team with a light glaze of humor and current events.</p>
<p>Drive team made a model field for practicing, and can successfully place 5 cubes in two minutes on the scale, 6 to the exchange, which is pretty impressive! good for them.</p>
<p>Electrical is busy making software and getting autonomous to work for the robot.</p>
<p>Mechanical making weight adjustment so arm wouldn’t fall, and more intakes for the robot (as they seem pretty fond of making)</p>
<p>Logistics finished budget and cost of robot (finally)</p>
<p>Communications did not do anything because no one was there, so that’s fun</p>
<p>Good day, Marsh</p>
