<p>What is up party people! It’s your boy Big Mac on the scene and I’m here to give you the low down in the beauties and complexities of the process called the La Jolla High School Robotics Club. Everyone has a story and I consider it my job to inform my dear readers of them. Stay tuned for more lovies, and prepare to learn.</p>
<p>Mechanical has been finishing the arm, ans in building it to near perfection and is getting ready to attach to the robot. Good for them.</p>

<p>Electrical is installing limit switches onto the robot, creating power adapters, and making an autonomous selector for the robot for it to know when to grab the cube. I also found this picture and I’m not sure whether to be scared or amused.</p>

<p>Communications is Finding out a plan to record matches so we can watch it later and analyze what we can do better next year. While drive team is constructing a pyramid in under 2 minutes and trying to see if they can get cubes behind the switch.</p>
<p>See you later, alligators!
