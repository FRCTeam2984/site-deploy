<p>With Mechanicals main job done Electrical and Software now need to hurry to make our robot drivable, create a better autonomous and make sure the arm can move, not in that order.</p>
<p>Electrical has started to attach wires onto the robot. In a mere 1 and a half hours they turned the robot from a cold metallic creature into a colorful cold metallic butterfly. Look!</p>

<p>Bad news is that at the end of yesterday’s meeting they found out that the motors are just a tad bit out of the frame perimeters. Mechanical has taken the job to fix the frame perimeter to keep everything in the designated zone and to stop us from being kicked out of the competition after 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Logistics is continuing to coordinate Competition Logistics. Drive Team is taking a break for today while the others work on making the another kitbot similar to this year’s robot.</p>
<p>Communications is continuing to contact other teams to coordinate things at the competition as well as creating tables to use during the competition for scouting purposes.</p>
