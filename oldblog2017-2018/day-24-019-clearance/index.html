<p>With the deadlines looming over us we have decided to change our schedule a bit. We are know planning to have the robot finished by next Wendsday which will give us another 20 hours to finish the mechanisms for the robot as well as some other stuff.</p>
<p>Aden is kinda sad about that</p>

<p>Mechanical has its work cut out for itself…literally. To create the new Wide chassis they have to cut the existing chassis to specs. This means the wheels have to be on the shorter side of the chassis instead of the long side. There are more specifics like how the chassis needs to be cut in a way that makes the wheel base unsymmetrical.</p>

<p>Communications is continuing to implement atom feed as well as beginning to make the website resemble the stylized template more. We are also hoping that Marshall comes back alive from the Basketball game. Logistics is responding to a couple of old sponsors who we had lost contact with.</p>

<p>Electrical has slowed to a halt but they are still strong in numbers, now isn’t the time to strike we must attack when there is only a few electrons. Electrical is writing documentation for code as well as working on the PID subsystems and LEDs for the robot.</p>
