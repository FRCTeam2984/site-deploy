<p>We are getting excited to be the best we can this season!</p>
<p>This week was the first of two clean-up meetings. Our four teams:
Logistics, Communications, Mechanical and Electrical cleaned up materials they will most likely use during the season.</p>
<p>Mechanical disassembled past yearâ€™s robots as well as cleaned up machining stations.</p>
<p>Software organized their electrical equipment and their Github accounts.</p>
<p>Communications organized the website you are seeing this on while Logistics worked on making the team t-shirts.</p>
