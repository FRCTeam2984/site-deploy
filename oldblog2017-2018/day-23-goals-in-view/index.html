<p>We are close to the chasm, the chasm of Failed Deadlines…but hey if we didn’t fall in it wouldn’t be Robotics. Let’s hope we can be a little less stressed next year.</p>
<p>Electrical and Software has been doing great this year and three weeks before the end of the season they are pretty much done with all of their jobs and are just tuning what is left. Today they are testing their adapter as well as the PID code and limit switches for the arm.</p>

<p>Communications is ordering pins today which can be given to people at the competition. We are also working on creating the brochures, implementing atom feed as well as creating a stylized template for the website. Logistics is continuing to contact old sponsors.</p>

<p>Mechanical is trying to find out a way to design bumpers that doesn’t also conflict with the possible scale mechanism. They should finish the mechanism by the end of tomorrow but it is looking pretty unlikely.</p>
