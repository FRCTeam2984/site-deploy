<p>The Build Season has begun!</p>
<p>There are four teams: Logistics, Mechanical, Communications and Software.</p>
<p>Software is busy updating the roboRIO (main brain of the robot), updating firmware and trying not to electrocute themselves.</p>
<p>Mechanical is working hard building a model for the field of play, and also building a basic chassis for the robot.

<p>Logistics is working on finances and budget. Making sure we have enough money for pizza.</p>
<p>Communications members are busy writing a blog, fleshing out the website, and tuning all its bells and whistles.</p>
