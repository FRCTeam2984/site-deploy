<p>We have nine days left to test, break, fix, and retest our wide chassis robot…the pressure is rising. We still need to assemble the Skyhook, the bumpers and the several other wooden intakes and then give them to Drive Team to test them.</p>

<p>Electronics finished the battery mount while Software finished arm control software, wrote autonomous documentation, paths for all three locations and made a way to select which autonomous path we would take from the drive station.</p>

<p>Mechanical finished creating the parts for the robot. They also finished assembling the Skyhook. Hooray! Now we can test it with the Drive Team and be sad that is broke because it would be our first time using it.</p>

<p>Right now Communications is lower on the priority list than Drive team so I’m working with them today…YAY?! Drive Team started out doing some drills with cubes. Zig-zagging through them, and passing through courses made of cubes but soon after lunch we received a gift. The robot was finally drivable and no team needed to work on it. WE FINALLY COULD DRIVE OUR ROBOT!!!</p>
<p>Here we have the Eiffel Tower…</p>

<p>Logistics is a bit sick still but we hope he can make a return on Monday we really need him and we miss him.</p>
<p>The Quote of the day is “I can just imagine a person drinking tea that is on fire”</p>
<p>The mood is skyhook.</p>
