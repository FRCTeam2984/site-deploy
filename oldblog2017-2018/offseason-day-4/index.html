<p>Working with a skeleton crew communications most of the work falls onto me. Its kinda like the end of a movie where all the important side characters disappear. so by default I have to pull this team through the lack of manpower so we may reach our peak once again.</p>
<p>Mechanical is testing out the current intake, fabricating new intakes to test to see if we could have a better one, and also working on bumpers for the robot. all great stuff.</p>
<p>The Nerd (being so because only one member of software is here, so thanks to Grant) is working on an anti-tilt mechanism so the robot won’t tip over and trying out doing a two cube autonomous. good luck to him.</p>
<p>Last and least (because it also has just 2 members) is the drive team who is in charge of teaching the “new recruit” the traitor of the communications team, learning to set up the field and learning how to drive.</p>
<p>The mood is: cold but efficient.</p>
