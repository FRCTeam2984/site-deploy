        <p>Goodbye all and to all a good night. That’s what I said to my teachers as I left school to go to Robotics. Little did they know I would spend another three hours on school campus…HAHA!</p>
<p>Communications if working on fixing technical issues with the website so that we can get more traffic through here. They are also working with Logistics to get pins ordered and are working to getting stickers for the team.</p>
<p>Drive team is working with Tanvir from Communications, they are now doing obstacle courses and timing said obstacle courses to get better at driving. Hopefully they will make Tabitha super confident in her driving skills.</p>

<p>Electrical team is still fixing the Roborio, But also a small division has split off and is chilling and helping build the bumpers for Mechanical (Division of labor)</p>
<p>Mechanical is also working on making the intakes and building the bumpers for the robot to make sure it doesn’t get a concussion. That would suck.</p>

<p>Mood Is Chile/Chilly (both the temperature and the country and the food)</p>
