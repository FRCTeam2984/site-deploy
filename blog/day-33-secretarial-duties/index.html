        <p>Wassup~
Marshall’s not here today. So his equally good-at-writing secretary, Niki, is here. Today has felt pretty lackluster so far but we have some noteworthy accomplishments.</p>
<p>The Drive Team is starting some drills and working on their skills. I’d say they’re doing well- oh wait nevermind they ran into a cube. Otherwise, it’s going well here.</p>

<p>Electronics and Programming are still doing the autonomous mode, at least thats what they told me. I’m not convinced yet.</p>
<p>Mechanical is working on building an arm for the robot, it looks alright but Max seems to think it could use a bit more improvement. And once Mechanical finishes that, Electronics can do something else besides autonomous!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Communications has been doing more stylizing stuff and obviously writing the reiteration of the bible. It seems like the team has gotten smaller since we started. Although I haven’t counted Lukas or Warren as people lately, so maybe it’s just that.</p>
<p>Logistics has to get a budget together and order the pins or something…<em>cough</em> Alex Please <em>cough</em></p>
<p>I don’t really know what else to say, so imagine that I’m Marshall and I said something funny. <em>insert laugh here</em></p>
<p>The mood today is “the same”</p>
<p>The quote today is “We have infrared sensors…we can be a roomba bot”</p>
