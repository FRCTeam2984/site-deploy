        <p>Today is a great day. You know why? Because our driver is driving, our mechanical team is fabricating, our robot is roboting and the Electrons have finished ALL their jobs. I mean their was so many of them that came consistently that Max is now having trouble finding things for them to do.</p>
<p>Logistics was trying to get the competition logistics approved by the other team leads. This means Alex was trying to see what things can be brought to the competition with relative ease (Just so we don’t decide to bring the Drill Press or something crazy like that). Sadly Alex was feeling pretty bad and had to go home early.</p>
<p>Hope you get better Alex!</p>

<p>Communications is on the short side of members today and so I, Tanvir have become Dr.Sir Drive Coach as well as trying to organize each of the members’ versions of the website.</p>
<p><img src="/images/20180207/alone.jpg" alt="Alone"></p>
<p>Drive Tabithar and I have figured out how to make a mock version of the field with powercubes behind other powercubes to try and resemble the switch as well as a pyramid of powercubes to resemble the power cube zone.</p>
<p>Something to note for future years, for the most part you can use materials from the games to ‘create’ versions of field elements to practice with. But let’s hope future Mechanical teams have a multitude of members to make field elements.</p>
<p>Electrical is learning Onshape and helping Mechanical wherever possible. Mechanical is creating the back bumpers for the robot as well as skyhook.</p>
<p><img src="/images/20180207/bumper-work.jpg" alt="Bumper Work"></p>
<p>The bumpers should look like this… then all we need is the covers…</p>

<p>The mood is plays.</p>
